## ✅ Feature Checklist

### Models

- [x] OpenAI Models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- [x] Ollama Integration
- [x] Hugging Face API support
- [ ] Open-source model integration via Candle
- [ ] Light LLM integration

### Agents

- [x] Tool-Calling Agent
- [x] CodeAgent
- [x] Planning Agent

The code agent is still in development, so there might be python code that is not yet supported and may cause errors. Try using the tool-calling agent for now.

### Tools

- [x] Google Search Tool
- [x] DuckDuckGo Tool
- [x] Website Visit & Scraping Tool
- [x] RAG Tool
- More tools to come...

### Other

 - [ ] Sandbox environment
 - [x] Streaming output
 - [x] Improve logging
- [x] Parallel execution

## 🚀 Quick Start

Warning: Since there is no implementation of a Sandbox environment, be careful with the tools you use. Preferrably run the agent in a controlled environment using a Docker container.

### Using Docker

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull akshayballal95/smolagents-rs:latest

# Run with your OpenAI API key
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here smolagents-rs -t "What is the latest news about Rust programming?"
```

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smolagents-rs.git
cd smolagents-rs

# Build the project
cargo build --release --features cli-deps

# Run the agent
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here ./target/release/smolagents-rs -t "Your task here"
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

```bash
smolagents-rs [OPTIONS] -t TASK

Options:
  -t, --task <TASK>          The task to execute
  -a, --agent-type <TYPE>    Agent type [default: function-calling]
  -l, --tools <TOOLS>        Comma-separated list of tools [default: duckduckgo,visit-website]
  -m, --model <TYPE>         Model type [default: open-ai]
  -k, --api-key <KEY>        API key for OpenAI or Hugging Face models
  --model-id <ID>            Model ID (e.g., "gpt-4" for OpenAI or "qwen2.5" for Ollama) [default: gpt-4o-mini]
  -u, --ollama-url <URL>     Ollama server URL [default: http://localhost:11434]
  -s, --stream               Enable streaming output
  -h, --help                 Print help
```

## 🌟 Examples

```bash
# Simple search task
smolagents-rs -t "What are the main features of Rust 1.75?"

# Research with multiple tools
smolagents-rs -t "Compare Rust and Go performance" -l duckduckgo,google-search,visit-website

# Stream output for real-time updates
smolagents-rs -t "Analyze the latest crypto trends" -s

# Run multiple tasks in parallel
cargo run --example parallel --features cli,code-agent
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Agent System**: Implements the ReAct framework.

2. **Tool System**: An extensible tool framework for seamless integration of new tools.

3. **Model Integration**: Robust OpenAI API integration for powerful LLM capabilities.

## 🚀 Why port to Rust?
Rust provides critical advantages that make it the ideal choice for smolagents-rs:

1. ⚡ **High Performance**:<br>
Zero-cost abstractions and no garbage collector overhead enable smolagents-rs to handle complex agent tasks with near-native performance. This is crucial for running multiple agents and processing large amounts of data efficiently.

2. 🛡️ **Memory Safety & Security**:<br>
Rust's compile-time guarantees prevent memory-related vulnerabilities and data races - essential for an agent system that handles sensitive API keys and interacts with external resources. The ownership model ensures thread-safe concurrent operations without runtime overhead.

3. 🔄 **Powerful Concurrency**:<br>
Fearless concurrency through the ownership system enable smolagents-rs to efficiently manage multiple agents and tools in parallel, maximizing resource utilization.

4. 💻 **Universal Deployment**:<br>
Compile once, run anywhere - from high-performance servers to WebAssembly in browsers. This allows smolagents-rs to run natively on any platform or be embedded in web applications with near-native performance.

Apart from this, its essential to push new technologies around agentic systems to the Rust ecoystem and this library aims to do so.
